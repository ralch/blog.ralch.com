This repository contains the articles published to my professional blog.

## Getting Started

First you need to setup your workstation. For that you can use homebrew to install all tools.

```bash
$ brew install hugo
$ brew install vim
```

Then you can create a new publication:

```bash
$ hugo new content/my-first-post.md
# for live view run the following command
$ hugo server
```

## Deploy

For more information how to deploy the website, have a look at the official
